The SSH protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another.

There are a few basic Git commands that you will always use. 
When starting out with a new repository, you only need create it once: either locally, and then push to GitHub, or by cloning an existing repository by using the command "git init".
"git add" moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
"git status" allows you to see the state of your working directory and the staged snapshot of your changes. 
"git commit" takes your staged snapshot of changes and commits them to the project. 
"git reset" undoes changes that you’ve made to the files in your working directory. 
"git log" enables you to browse previous changes to a project. 
"git branch" lets you create an isolated environment within your repository to make changes. 
"git checkout" lets you see and change existing branches. 
"git merge" lets you put everything back together again. 

GitHub is the online hosting service for Git repositories.
Repositories is data structure store documents including application source code and enable contributors to track and maintain version-control.
What is special about the Git Repository model? Git is designed as a distributed version-control system. 
Primarily focused on tracking source code during development. 
Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and support non-linear workflows.

An organization is a collection of user accounts that owns repositories. 
Organizations have one or more owners, who have administrative privileges for the organization.
Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.

Module Summary
In this module, you learned that:

A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) keeps track of changes to code, regardless of where it is stored. This allows multiple users to work on the same codebase or repository, mirroring the codebase on their own computers if needed, while the distributed version control software helps manage synchronization amongst the various codebase mirrors.

Repositories are storage structures that:

Store the code

Track issues and changes

Enable you to collaborate with others

G​it is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket are examples of hosted version control systems.

All files in GitHub exist on a branch. 
The Master Branch contains the finished, deployable version of the code. 
Create new branches when you need to change the code. 
The new branch starts as an exact copy of the original branch. 
As you make changes, the branch that you created holds the changed code. 
More than one branch can be undergoing changes at the same time. 
Saved changes are called commits. 
Pull requests enables other users to review and use the proposed changes (committed). 
When you are ready to merge the changed code into the master branch, you merge the committed code changes into your master code.
